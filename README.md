## About the project:
- This is a template for store owners looking for a pre-made website for their stores. 
- The initial purpose of this template was to act as a functional website for an actual shop. This was later deployed as an e-commerce website template. 
- As of now, this template is being used by helios to develop a functional e-commerce website to sell merchandise. 

### This website is deployed and can be viewed using this link https://faizaan-nasir.github.io/ShopOnline/src/

## Who are we?
- Working on this repo: @amazinglySK, @Faizaan-Nasir and @TanmeenPatel
- We are a bunch of high-schoolers experimenting different designs for webpages. 
- We have used only three languages to come up with this template: CSS, JavaScript and HTML5. We are fluent in other languages too, you may read more about us on our individual pages.

## Pros and cons:
- This website is specifically designed to update the data once a day for a given user, this improves efficiency and thus needs lesser amount of requests to the server per user.
- This template is not very readable as of yet. Comments will be added in future updates.
