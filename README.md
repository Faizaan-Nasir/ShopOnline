# ShopOnline ðŸ›’

## About the project:
- This is a template for store owners looking for a pre-made website for their stores. 
- The initial purpose of this template was to act as a functional website for an actual shop. This was later deployed as an e-commerce website template. 
- As of now, this template is being used by helios to develop a functional e-commerce website to sell merchandise. 

### This website is deployed and can be viewed using this link https://faizaan-nasir.github.io/ShopOnline/src/
